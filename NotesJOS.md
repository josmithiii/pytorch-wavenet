Here's what I've done to address the overfitting:
Added dropout layers to the WaveNet model:
Input dropout after the initial convolution
Residual dropout for the residual connections
Skip dropout for the skip connections
Default dropout rate of 0.2
Modified training parameters:
Increased batch size from 16 to 32 for better generalization
Added L2 regularization with weight_decay=0.01
Reduced learning rate from 0.001 to 0.0005
Increased validation subset size from 500 to 1000 samples
More frequent validation checks (every 500 steps instead of 1000)


‚è∫ The diffs show significant improvements to the codebase:

  1. demo.py:
    - Added comprehensive command-line arguments for model configuration
    - Improved audio generation with better sampling and temperature handling
    - Added proper resuming of training from checkpoints
    - Better TensorBoard integration and logging
    - More informative output and training tips
  2. wavenet_model.py:
    - Added dropout support for regularization
    - Improved model loading with better error handling
    - Added a dilated_conv method for explicit padding control
    - Fixed forward pass with better tensor reshaping
    - Added a calculate_receptive_field method
  3. wavenet_training.py:
    - Better shape handling with warnings for mismatches
    - Improved validation loop with shape adjustments
    - More detailed logging during training
    - Fixed time tracking using time.time() instead of datetime

  Overall, these changes make the codebase more robust, provide better
  configurability, and fix issues with tensor shapes during training.
